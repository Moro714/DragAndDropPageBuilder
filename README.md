# DragAndDropPageBuilder

## Overview
This is a **drag-and-drop website builder** designed to make website creation simple and accessible. The project is currently focused on building a **frontend editor**, with plans to develop a **backend system** in the future.

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for designing web pages
- **Prebuilt components** like text blocks, images, and buttons
- **Customizable styles** (colors, fonts, layouts)
- **Live preview** of the design
- **Export to HTML/CSS** (planned)
- **User authentication & backend support** (future implementation)

## Installation
Currently, the project is in early development, and installation steps will be provided once the frontend reaches a stable version.


## Roadmap
1. **Complete the frontend editor** (drag and drop functionality, UI components, export options)
2. **Build a backend system** (user authentication, project saving, database integration)
3. **Enhance UI/UX** with more customization options
4. **Deploy a working demo**
